                        description={`Given my architecture background, I highly value organization and consistency. I believe a well-structured design system that is intuitive for designers and translatable to development is crucial for clarifying communication across teams, increasing efficiency, and minimizing discrepancies.
                        
                        To me, a strong design system follows a three-layer pyramid: Understanding, Flexibility, and Efficiency. With a solid understanding, components become clear and reusable; flexibility keeps them adaptable; and efficiency naturally follows.`
